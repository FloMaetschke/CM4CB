# CM4CB
Raspberry Pi CM4 Cluster Board

## About
The goal of this project is to create an ATX Board hosting multiple Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).

The plan is to power the board by a standard ATX power supply you would normally use.
The ethernet connection on board will use one (or multiple?) 7 port Gigabit-Ethernet switch(es) [KSZ9567S](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/KSZ9567S-Data-Sheet-DS00002393C.pdf) connected by the transformer-ICs magnetics modules [H5007NL](https://www.mouser.de/datasheet/2/336/HC500-220797.pdf).

## Software
This project is based on the latest kicad nightly build. This is required to open the official CM4io project from Raspbery Pi Foundation.

## Status
I am actually in the planning phase, designing the schematics.
